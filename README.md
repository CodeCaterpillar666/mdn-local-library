This is my repo for learning [MDN Express Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs).

This repo was initiated when I was doing [Tutorial Part 6 - Challenge Yourself](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms#challenge_yourself), only finished adding genre-delete feature.
