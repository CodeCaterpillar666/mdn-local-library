## Source
This is my repo for learning [MDN Express Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs).
## Start Point
This repo was initiated when I was doing [Tutorial Part 6 - Challenge Yourself](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms#challenge_yourself), only finished adding genre-delete feature. 
## Questions
Some questions after completing this tutorial:
1. Views
    1. What is the difference between template engines and front-end library/framwork like React and Vue?
    2. How to depend which one should I choose, template engines or React?
    3. How to switch from template engines to React for my project here?
2. How to add authentication on this project?
3. How to deploy this project onto some other cloud, say AWS?
4. How to write good commit messages and README.md?
## Plans
1. Add search engine.
2. Improve UI. May even switch from template engine to React.
